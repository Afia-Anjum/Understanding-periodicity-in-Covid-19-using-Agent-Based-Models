## Understanding periodicity in COVID-19

Given that variability of diagnostic testing, hospital/clinic closures or reduced staffing may artificially contribute to observed COVID-19 peaks and troughs, it is important to confirm if COVID-19 periodicity occurs and under what conditions and if periodicity occurs, could we use this information to predict future infection peaks. Here, we examined world COVID-19 infections and deaths by country, climate, GDP as well as US states and Canadian provinces to determine if periodic oscillations were present. To study COVID-19 oscillations, we obtained COVID-19 cases and deaths data from several countries via Worldometer and analyzed the observed periodicity to discover the behavioral settings, causes, and parameters associated with the appearance and disappearance of periodicity. We then used the identified parameters to recreate COVID-19 periodicity using ABM modelling. To our knowledge, ABM modelling has not been used to generate and validate weekly periodic oscillations. Here, we used ABM modelling to study COVID-19 periodic oscillations in the daily number of cases and deaths and the impact of various factors including COVID-19 incubation period, reporting effects, and lockdowns and travel restrictions on COVID-19 periodicity. Our various models demonstrated that COVID-19 periodicity occurred differently depending on the incubation period, if reporting was interrupted or isolation barriers were in place. Such modelling could aid in decision-making of public mitigation strategies that would minimize the impact of COVID-19 worldwide.
